![Shopping Cart Screenshot](./md_images/display.png)

## 💡 **Description:**

Welcome! This project is a small e-commerce application where you can find a variety of products like cars, MacBooks, and shoes. The main goal of this project was to practice implementing basic shopping cart functionalities such as adding and removing items, calculating totals, and managing the cart's state.

Additionally, this project served as my first introduction to creating a React application, driven by market demands for React skills. It was a great opportunity to enhance my understanding of frontend development.

The project was built following a tutorial by Professor Basir from the "Coding with Basir" channel. You can view the video that guided this project here: [React Shopping Cart Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0B8AETwew).
